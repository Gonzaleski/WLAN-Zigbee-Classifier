## **Project Overview**

The 2.4 GHz ISM band is a busy place, with protocols like Wi-Fi and Zigbee constantly vying for space. In environments like smart homes, industrial IoT, or crowded offices, distinguishing between these signals can be a significant challenge.

This project addresses that problem by developing a lightweight, AI-based classifier that identifies Zigbee and Wi-Fi signals from spectrogram images. Built with MATLAB and deep learning, the system classifies time-frequency spectrograms into three categories: Zigbee, WLAN, and Background. The solution supports both synthetic signal generation and live signal classification using an ADALM-PLUTO SDR.

This project is designed as part of the [Mathworks AI Challenge](https://uk.mathworks.com/academia/students/competitions/student-challenge/ai-challenge.html).
